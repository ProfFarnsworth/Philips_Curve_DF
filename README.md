# Philips_Curve_DF

  This Dataset issues multiple functions of statistics pulled from US National Accounts and Macroconomic data to allow for the practice of forecasting
Phillips Curves using quarterly data between 1946 and 2019. Within the Dataset, compared are: the observed dates in two period (obs), the Federal Reserve 
estimate of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (nairu), annual rate of inflation by % change in CPI (infl), the unemployment rate % 
(unrate), change in rate of inflation for inflation_t - inflation_t-1 (d_infl), and the difference of unemployment or unemployment - nairu (u_diff). 

  Please explore this dataset and create models to practice your newly learned macroeconomic concepts, or utilize it to serve as precedent in certain 
  economic trends and predict the future!
